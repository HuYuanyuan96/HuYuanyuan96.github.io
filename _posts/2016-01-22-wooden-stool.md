description: The design of this stool is an experiment of the structure. I separated each foot of the stool into two parts and joint them with different Rungs, forming three identical wooden components. These leg pieces are locked by a curved acrylic panel and three nylon Footpad. No nail is needed in this design, so users can assemble and disassemble it within a minute.

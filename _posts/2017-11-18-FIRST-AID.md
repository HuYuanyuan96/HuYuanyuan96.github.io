## Background Research

Over the past two decades, China’s population has been aging rapidly. As a result of China’s “one-child” policy and low mortality, the proportion of elderly citizens will continue to grow very quickly, increasing the stress on an already troubled health care system. Most of them surfer from chronic diseases and have to take care of themselves.

## Further Research & Problem Analysis

According to NHS report, around one in three adults over 65 living at home have at least one fall a year, and about half of them have more frequent falls. Most falls don't result in serious injury. However, most of Chinese older people have circulation system disease,such as hypertension, cerebrovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. If they fall down, it can cause serious harm, even to death.
